image Classification with SVM and CV Studio
In this lab, you will learn how to train and use Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify dogs and cats with the provided dataset.

Opening the tool will direct you to CV Studio. We have already created a project template for you, so you can get right to the action!

To upload the dataset, open the drop down menu at the top right of the page and click "Upload from URL".

Then copy and paste the following URL of the dataset into the appropriate box and click OK:

https://cv-studio-accessible.s3.us-south.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/cats_dogs_images_.zip

Note: if your internet connection is slow some images may fail to upload, don't worry, your lab will still run.
