Obtain IBM Cloud Feature Code and Activate Trial Account:

To facilitate hands-on skills development and enable you to complete some of the labs in this course, we are providing you with a special feature code for IBM Cloud. 

This feature code will enable you to either create an IBM Cloud account without a credit card. 

Please check the box and click on the "Open tool" button below to get a unique Feature Code to activate your IBM Cloud trial account.

We have also provided you with the stepwise instructions on how to create an IBM Cloud account for your reference.

NOTE: If you have already applied your IBM Cloud feature code in another course/lab to create an IBM Cloud account, please skip this item, as the code can only be used once.   

CAUTION:

While signing up for an IBM Cloud account, or at a later stage, you may be prompted to enter a credit card. Please note that access to paid services or a credit card is NOT required to complete any mandatory labs/projects / or assignments in this course. Instead, those enrolled in this course have access to a Feature Code, which enables trial access to IBM Cloud for a limited duration. Therefore, we strongly recommend that you DO NOT enter a credit card to complete the required course components.

If you still choose to enter your Credit Card to use IBM Cloud services, you will be liable to pay any resulting charges billed to your credit card. The course team does not take any responsibility for such charges.

In case you encounter issues while activating your account with a Feature Code, or your trial has ended, and you have not yet completed the course, please contact the course support team via the course discussions forums for assistance instead of adding a credit card to your IBM Cloud account.
