Use CNN for "Hotdog, Not Hotdog" Classifier and Deploy Model with CV Studio
In this lab, you will use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify whether an image is a hotdog or not a hotdog with the provided dataset.

Opening the tool will direct you to CV Studio. We have already created a project template for you, so you can get right to the action!

To upload the dataset, open the drop down menu at the top right of the page and click "Upload from URL".



Then copy and paste the following URL of the dataset into the appropriate box and click OK:

https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-CV0101EN-Coursera/labs/Module4/images_100_hotdogs_v2.zip

Note: if your internet connection is slow some images may fail to upload, don't worry, your lab will still run. 

#This course uses a third-party app, Use CNN for "Hotdog, Not Hotdog" Classifier and Deploy Model with CV Studio , to enhance your learning experience. The app will reference basic information like your name, email, and Coursera ID.
