Car Detection with Haar Classifiers
In this notebook, you will learn how to detect a car in an image using the Haar Cascade Classifiers. You will use CV Studio with a pre-trained detector and will not need to upload any dataset for this lab.

When creating the project make sure the Type of the project is set to Object Detection as shown below.
For this lab, You will not need to upload any data, you will be using a pre-trained dataset, start from the Use Model to open the notebook.

Object Detection using Pre-trained Models CV Studio
In this lab, you will use MobileNet with Single Shot MultiBox Detector model  as a pre-trained model to detect whether someone is wearing a mask or not wearing a mask. In addition, you will also deploy the app, similar to the CNN classification lab. 

Upload the dataset by URL, through the drop down "Upload" menu, as you have done with previous labs. 
Use the following URL:

https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-CV0101EN-Coursera/dataset/images.zip

Alternatively, you can download the 
dataset
 and upload it manually. If you choose to do so, make sure the file is zipped when you upload the dataset.

You will use CV Studio to upload and label images, and to train and deploy Computer Vision models.
