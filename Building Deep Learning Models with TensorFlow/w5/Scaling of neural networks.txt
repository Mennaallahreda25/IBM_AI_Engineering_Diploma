 (part of IBM Cloud Pak for Data)

How to scale your model training using multi CPU or GPU runtimes

In the previous sections you learned how to train various deep learn  models. This section you will learn how to use Watson Studio to scale  model training to multipe CPUs or GPUs. You don't need a credit card and  up to 100 hours of free runtimes are included, every month, never  expiring

Please follow the 
instructions : https://github.com/claimed-framework/component-library/wiki/
